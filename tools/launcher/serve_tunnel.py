"""Serve a wasm build locally AND expose it over an HTTPS Cloudflare quick
tunnel, then show a QR code for the public URL so a phone can open it with a
camera scan instead of typing a long address.

Why a tunnel: the web viewer's WebGPU backend needs a *secure context* --
browsers only expose WebGPU (navigator.gpu) over https:// or localhost.  Plain
http:// on a LAN IP is not secure, so a phone can't get a WebGPU adapter.  A
trycloudflare.com URL is real HTTPS, which satisfies the requirement.

Requires cloudflared (`scoop install cloudflared`).  QR rendering uses
`npx qrcode --small` (node-qrcode) when Node is available; otherwise it just
prints the URL.

Usage: python3 serve_tunnel.py <directory> [port]
